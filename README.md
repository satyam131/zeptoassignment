Key Features:  <br />

1.Dynamic Suggestions:     <br />
Upon clicking the input field, a list of items appears.  <br />
As the user types, the list dynamically filters to show only items matching the input.  <br />

2.Chip Creation:<br />
Clicking on an item in the list turns it into a chip at the top.<br />
The input field adjusts automatically, providing a seamless user experience.<br />

3.Chips Management:<br />
Each chip features an "X" icon.<br />
Clicking the "X" icon removes the chip and adds the item back to the list.<br />

4.Clean Code and TypeScript:<br />
The codebase adheres to clean coding practices for maintainability and readability.<br />
TypeScript is utilized for improved type safety and code clarity.<br />

5.Backspace Functionality:<br />
When the input is blank, pressing backspace highlights the last chip.<br />
A second press on backspace removes the highlighted chip.<br />
